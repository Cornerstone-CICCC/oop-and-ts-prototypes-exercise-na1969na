// Exercise 2: Create a Prototype with Chaining and Inheritance
// Instructions:
// 1. Create a constructor function called "Device" with a "brand" property and a method "powerOn" that logs "[brand] device is now powered on."
// 2. Create another constructor function called "Smartphone" that inherits from Device, and add a "model" property to Smartphone.
// 3. Add a method "call" to Smartphone's prototype that logs "Calling from [brand] [model]..."

// YOUR CODE HERE
function Device(brand) {
  this.brand = brand;
}

Device.prototype.powerOn = function () {
  console.log(`${this.brand} device is now powered on.`);
};

function Smartphone(brand, model) {
  Device.call(this, brand);
  this.model = model;
}

Smartphone.prototype = Object.create(Device.prototype);
Smartphone.prototype.constructor = Smartphone;

Smartphone.prototype.call = function() {
  console.log(`Calling from ${this.brand} ${this.model}...`);
};

// Test the Smartphone prototype with inheritance
const myPhone = new Smartphone("Apple", "iPhone 14");
myPhone.powerOn(); // Output: Apple device is now powered on. (inherited from Device)
myPhone.call(); // Output: Calling from Apple iPhone 14. (defined in Smartphone)
